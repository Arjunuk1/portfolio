## ⚙️ Setup & Configuration

### GitHub API Configuration (Recommended)

The portfolio fetches projects from GitHub. To avoid API rate limits:

1. **Create a GitHub Personal Access Token:**
   - Go to [GitHub Settings > Tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens)
   - Click "Generate new token (classic)"
   - Give it a name (e.g., "Portfolio Website")
   - No special scopes are needed for public repositories
   - Generate and copy the token

2. **Add the token to your project:**
   - Create a `.env` file in the project root (use `.env.example` as template)
   - Add: `VITE_GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_token_here`

3. **Benefits:**
   - **Without token:** 60 API requests/hour (easily exceeded)
   - **With token:** 5,000 API requests/hour
   - **Caching:** Projects are cached for 1 hour to reduce API calls

### Running Locally

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build
```
